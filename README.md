# Intelligent-Customer-Service

## Overview

**Intelligent-Customer-Service** is an advanced conversational AI platform designed to deliver natural, human-like customer support.  
It combines large language model (LLM) fluency, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), business logic integration, and thoughtful UX design to create a customer care layer that actually solves problems and seamlessly escalates to human agents when needed.

## Key Features

- **Conversational AI:**  
  Multi-turn chat that feels natural and human, with optional voice input/output.

- **Real Answers via RAG:**  
  Connects to knowledge sources (documentation, FAQs, ticket databases) using retrieval-augmented generation for accurate, up-to-date responses.

- **Intent & Slot Extraction:**  
  Understands customer requests and extracts actionable details for tasks like refunds, order tracking, or plan changes.

- **Smart Escalation:**  
  Confidence-based handoff to human agents, including a context summary for efficient resolution.

- **Admin UI:**  
  Simple interface for viewing conversation logs, analytics, and adjusting persona/canned responses.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction:**  
   Customers interact via chat (or voice), asking questions or requesting actions.

2. **LLM + RAG:**  
   The system uses LLMs and retrieval from business data sources to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

3. **Business Logic Connectors:**  
   Integrates with backend systems to perform actions (e.g., process refunds, track orders).

4. **Confidence-Based Escalation:**  
   If the AI is unsure, it hands off to a human agent, providing a summary of the conversation and extracted details.

5. **Admin Tools:**  
   Admins can review logs, monitor analytics, and tweak the system’s persona and canned replies.
